The tabs included in Max's Tab Page are my interpretation of the songs and are my own work. 
I tab songs only as personal reference notes to my failing memory. 
You may only use these files for private study, scholarship, or research. 
If you don't see a song you like in my collection it means either 
A) It is already posted accurately enough on the web or 
B) The guitar part of the song is not challenging enough to warrant tabbing or 
C) I think that song sucks!

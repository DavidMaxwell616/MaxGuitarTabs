Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city.
Asus2            Em                                       Asus2
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee.
  Em              D                           Asus2
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story.

"My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine.
Asus2              Em                                           Asus2
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine.

Asus2              Em                                           Asus2

  Asus2        Em                                   Asus2

I got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around.
Asus2            Em                                        Asus2
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me.
  Em                   D               Asus2
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me.

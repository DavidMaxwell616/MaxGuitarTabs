Dire Wolf
[Verse 1]
       G
In the timbers of Fennario
    Bb                  F
The wolves are running 'round
    F
The winter was so hard and cold
                          G
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground
[Chorus]
             F     G
Don't murder me
         C       Csus2 C   F
I beg of you, don't murder me
G     F                C
  Please, don't murder me
 [Verse 2]
  G
I sat down to my supper
 Bb                       F
'Twas a bottle of red whisky
  F
I said my prayers and went to bed
           C         C/B C/Bb Am
That's the last they saw of   me
[Chorus]
             G     F
Don't murder me
         C       Csus2 C   F
I beg of you, don't murder me
G     F                C      C C/B
  Please, don't murder me
[Verse 3]
C/Bb Am           G
When I awoke, the Dire Wolf
    C       Bb        F
Six hundred pounds of sin
    F
Was grinning at my window
                        G
All I said was "Come on in"
[Chorus]
             F     G
Don't murder me
         C          E7     Am
I beg of you, don't murder me
G     F                C      C C/B
  Please, don't murder me
[Verse 4]
The  Wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
C/A    G
In the backwash of Fennario
    Bb               F
The black and bloody mire
    F
The Dire Wolf collects his due
                               G
While the boys sing 'round the fire
[Chorus] 
[Chorus]

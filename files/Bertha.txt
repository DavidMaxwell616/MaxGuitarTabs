Bertha
[Intro]
G           G     G  C     G     G  G

[Verse 1]
         C                             G     C/G
I had a hard run, runnin' from your window
                C                                      G      C/G
I was all night runnin', runnin', Lord I wonder if you care
        C                      G       C/G
I had a run in, run around and run down
               C                                       G C/G
Run around the corner, corner, Lord I run smack into a tree
[Chorus]
         D     Am     G            C  D
I had to move, move, really had to move
C                 G            D              C
That's why if you please, I am on my bended knees
Am                     C            G/C               
Bertha don't you come around here anymore

(Repeat Intro)
[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea
Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines                      
I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin, I turned around to see
Heard a voice callin', you were comin' after me
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm, I ducked back into a bar door
It's all night pourin', pourin', Lord but not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, why don't you arrest me
Throw me into the jail house, Lord until the sun goes down 
(Chorus - Repeat a few times)

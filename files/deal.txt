Deal
[Verse 1]
A                C#7         F#m      E       D7    D#dim7
Since it costs a lot to win, and even more to lose
A                            F#   B7                 D7
You and me better spend more time wonderin' what to choose
A                 C#7              F#m        E                 D7             D#dim7
Goes to show, you don't ever know, watch each card you play and please play it slow 
[Chorus]
A               G          D
Wait until that deal come 'round
A                  G       D     A
Don't you let that deal go down, no no 
[Verse 2]
I been gamblin' hereabouts for ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears
Goes to show, you don't ever know, watch each card you play and please play it slow
[Chorus]
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me and tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sittin' there composing lonesome blues
Goes to show, you don't ever know, watch each card you play and please play it slow
[Chorus]

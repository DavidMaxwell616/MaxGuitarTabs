Eyes Of The World
Emaj7   B   A
Emaj7              A           Emaj7  A  Emaj7   Bm A
Right outside this lazy summer home
Emaj7                           A              Emaj7    A  Emaj7  Bm  A
You ain’t got time to call your soul a critic, no
A                 C#m      B                   A
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
C#m                 B                  D             A
Wonderin’ where the nut-thatch winter’s wings a mile long
Emaj             A    Emaj7   A  Emaj7   A   C
Just carried the bird away
[Chorus]
G                        C                       G       C
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
        G                          C                             G    C   C#
But the heart has its beaches, its homelands and thoughts of its own
D                        C                     G                  C
Wake now, discover, that you are the song that morning brings
        G                          C                           D  Dsus4 D  Bm  A
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own
There comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades away
There follows a wagon behind him that’s loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay-  ay
And night comes so quiet it’s close on the heels of the day
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

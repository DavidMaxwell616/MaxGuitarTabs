Ripple
[Verse 1]
   G                                     C
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
C                                        G
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
G                                        C
Would you hear my voice come through the music
C         G       D    C               G
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
[Verse 2]
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
[Chorus]
Am              D
Ripple in still water
           G            C
When there is no pebble tossed
    A       D
Nor wind to blow 
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men 
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
[Chorus]
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home
           G                C
Lat da dat da, Lah da-ah da da, da
C                                G
La da da, la da, da da da-ah, da da
G                           C
Lat da dat da, Lah da-ah da da, da
G        D   C            G
La da da da, Lah da da da da

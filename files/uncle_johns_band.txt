Woh - oh, what I want to know,    is are you kind? 
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend; better take my advice.
You know all the rules by now, and the fire from the ice.
Will you come with me, won't you come with me?
Woh - oh, what I want to know,    will you come with me? 
Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannonballs, their motto is don't tread on me.
Come hear Uncle John's Band, playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows.
Like the morning sun you come, and like the wind you go.
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait\
Woh - oh, what I want to know,    where does the time go?
I live in a silver mine, and I call it Beggar's Tomb
I got me a violin, and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice.
Woh - oh, what I want to know,    how does the song go?
Come hear the Uncle John's Band, by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the risin' tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band, playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone, he's come to take his children home
Woh - oh, what I want to know,   how does the song go?
Come hear the Uncle John's Band, by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the risin' tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band, playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone, he's come to take his children home

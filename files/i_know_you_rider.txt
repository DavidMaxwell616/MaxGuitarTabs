  D                    C       G        D
I know you rider gonna miss me when I'm gone
  D                    C       G        D
I know you rider gonna miss me when I'm gone
      F         C         F       C   Em   D
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms
[Verse]
Lay down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Lay down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the west
The sun will shine in my back door some-day
The sun will shine in my back door some-day
March winds will blow all my trou-bles a-way 
I wish I was a headlight, on a North-bound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a North-bound train
I'd shine my light though the cool Colo-ra-do rain
I'd rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
I'd rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Than stay here in Frisco and get treated like a dog 
I know you rider gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you rider gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms
      F         C         F       C  Em    D
Gonna miss your baby from rolling in your arms

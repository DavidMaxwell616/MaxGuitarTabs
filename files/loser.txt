Am          G             C       D
If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn,
C             Em               Am
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Am               C G   Em               D
Don't ya push me baby 'cause I'm moanin low
        C        C/B  Am    G       Am
And you know I'm only in it for the gold
[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man
[Chorus]
G         D           A
Last fair deal in the country, sweet Suzy
G         D           A
Last fair deal in the town
G             D                A
Put your gold money where your love is baby
  C        C/B    Am   G  D             Am
Before you let my deal go down.......go down
[Verse 3] 
Don't you push me baby cause I'm moaning low
Well I know a little something you won't never know
Dont ya touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
I'm gonna get up in the morning and go
[Verse 4]
Everybody’s braggin’ and drinkin’ that wine
I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time

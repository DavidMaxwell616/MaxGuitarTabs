Me & My Uncle

[Verse]
Em        G                 Em
Me and my uncle went ridin' down
            G               Em
South Color-ado, West Texas bound
           G             Em
We stopped over in Santa Fe
           G                G#   A
That point being just about half way
    G                   B7                  Em
And you know it was the hottest part of the day
[Verse]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It bein' summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they're loaded down
So soon after payday, you know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand
[Solo]
[Verse]
My uncle starts winnin' - cowboys got sore
One of them called him and then two more
Accused him of cheatin' - oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle - he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, hot damn, he won't grow old
And in the confusion my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexi-co
[Verse]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead-ass there by the side of the road

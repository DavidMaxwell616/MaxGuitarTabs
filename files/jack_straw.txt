Jack Straw - Grateful Dead (Hunter, Weir)
 
 
[Verse 1]
E                F#m                     C#m  A
We can share the women, we can share the wine
E                 Bm                  D        A                  E   G#m  D  A
We can share what we've got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine.
E                F#m            C#m  A
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go,
E                Bm     D             A               E   B  A  E  E7
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow.
 
 
[Verse 2]
E7sus4            E7        E7sus4            E7
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence,
E7sus4               E7               E7sus4            E7
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that heaven sent?
 
 
[Verse 3]
F#7sus4          F#7              F#7sus4          F#7
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see,
F#7sus4           F#7                  F#7sus4            D  Bm  A  E
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well been me.
 
 
[Verse 4]
D          Bm       A                       E
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
D             Bm                  A                       E
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife.
D           Bm     A                        E
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall;
D              Bm        A         E                     A
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all,
         D  G D  G F# F E Esus4 E Esus4 E
Not with all.
 
 
[Verse 5]
E             F#m              C#m  A
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July,
E               Bm           D      A                E G#m D  A
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.
E                 F#m                   C#m  A
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe,
E                  Bm         D         A              E B A  E  E7
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne from sea to shining sea.
 
 
[Verse 6]
E7sus4      E7     E7sus4             E7
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride,
E7sus4         E7            E7sus4             E7
Got to settle one old score, one small point of pride.
F#7sus4          F#7                     F#7sus4             F#7
Ain't no place a man can hide, Shannon, to keep him from the sun;
F#7sus4          F#7                   F#7sus4         D Bm A  E
Ain't no bed can give us rest, now, you keep us on the run.
 
 
[Verse 7]
D    Bm          A                    E
Jack Straw from Wichita cut his buddy down,
D           Bm     A                             E
And dug for him a shallow grave and laid his body down.
D      Bm         A                     E
Half a mile from Tucson, by the morning light,
D       Bm        A             E                   A                D   G D  G F# F E Esus4 E Esus4 E
One man gone and another to go, my old buddy you're moving much too slow.
 
 
[Verse 8]
E                F#m                     C#m   A
We can share the women, we can share the wine.

lyrics:
A
Winding your way down on Baker Street
A
Light in your head, and dead on your feet
     Em                     G
Well another crazy day, you drink the night away
    D
And forget about everything

A
This city's dance makes you feel so cold, it's got
A
So many people but its got no soul
        Em                   G
And its taken you so long to find out you were wrong
         D
When you thought it held everything.

Dm                            Am
You used to think that it was so easy
Dm                          Am
You used to say that it was so easy
    C              G             D
But you're trying, you're trying now
Dm                          Am    
Another year and then you'd be happy
Dm                                Am
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
    C              G             A    G
But you're crying, you're crying now

(Repeat Solo)

A
Way down the street there's a light in his place
A
You open the door, he's got that look on his face
       Em                               G
And he asks you where you've been, you tell him who you've seen
        D
And you talk about everything

A
He's got this dream about buying some land
A
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
    Em                             G
And then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town
    D
And forget about everything

Dm                        Am
But you know he'll always keep moving
Dm                        Am 
You know he's never gonna stop moving
C                   G                D
Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
Dm                          Am
And when you wake up it's a new morning
Dm                        Am
The sun is shining it's a new morning
C                 G            A     D
And you're going, you're going home

(Repeat Intro)

(Repeat Solo 1)
